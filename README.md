# Tiro Game Engine
A simple game engine written in c and opengl, with minal dependencies. 
This project is just my way to learn graphics programming (opengl in particular) and get more
conforable writing c, I am a noob and the scope of this engine will be very limited.

## Dependencies
- Meson (build system)
- OpenGL
- GLFW

## Compile & Run
- To compile the project just run `meson compile -C build` when in the root of the project
- To compile and run just make run.sh executable and run it
    - (i have to fix the shader loading relative path handling, that's why runnig the program is so ugly :c)
